SecureWeb - Real-time Data Dashboard
Stack: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
Description: A performance-first dashboard prototype built without heavy JavaScript frameworks.

* Advanced CSS/Tailwind: Utilized for complex grid layouts, glassmorphism (backdrop-blur), and hardware-accelerated keyframe animations.
* SVG Manipulation: Created custom, multi-layer gauges and a dynamic network map using SVG strokes and dash-offsets to simulate data flow.
* Responsive Architecture: Implemented a mobile-first approach, ensuring complex data grids stack legibly on smaller devices while maintaining the visual hierarchy.
